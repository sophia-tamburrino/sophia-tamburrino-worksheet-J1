## #1: What is fault localization?
**Fault localization is a term used to describe the process of debugging your code.** This includes tracing your code to find out what line produced the error, and fixing that error.
## #2: What are the three benefits of test driven development (TDD)?
* Tests are not biased by your code
* Writing tests assists in writing actual code
* Writing tests helps you think about the requirements of your system
## #3: What are the input domain paritions for this exercise?
* One or more numbers between 0-999
  * ("password90", valid)
  * ("password", invalid)
* At least one uppercase letter in [A-Z]
  * ("Password", valid)
  * ("password", invalid)
* At least one lowercase letter in [a-z]
  * ("PaSSWORD", valid)
  * ("PASSWORD", invalid)
* Cannot contain string 'gmail'
  * ("yahoopassword", valid)
  * ("gmailpassword", invalid)
* Can be made of one or more numbers 0-999, letters from [a-z][A-Z], and the char '_'
  * ("password_25", valid)
  * ("password", invalid)

## #4 Truth Table
Predicate Outcome: (a > b) or G

Clause Responsible: ((a > b) or G) and (x < y)

|  a > b   | G | x < y | predicate outcome | clause responsible |
| -------- | - | ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
|    T     | T |   T   |         T         |          T         |  
|    T     | F |   F   |         T         |          F         |    
|    F     | T |   T   |         T         |          T         |    
|    F     | F |   T   |         F         |          F         |    
|    T     | T |   F   |         T         |          F         |    
|    T     | F |   T   |         T         |          T         |    
|    F     | T |   F   |         T         |          F         |    
|    F     | F |   F   |         F         |          F         |    

## #5 Paths
``` Java
Paths that achieve full path coverage:
12567
134357
1257
1357
This is a finite set because the nodes and edges are countable.
```

## #6 What benefit does mutation testing offer over other testing methods discussed in class?
[Definition Link](https://cs2113-f24.github.io/j/software_testing)

Mutation testing means changing the structure of the code in order to manually make bugs to detect. Doing this is better because you know exactly where the bugs are and the process is fully automated.
