## #4 Truth Table
Predicate Outcome: (a > b) or G

Clause Responsible: ((a > b) or G) and (x < y)

|  a > b   | G | x < y | predicate outcome | clause responsible |
| -------- | - | ----- | ----------------- | ------------------ |
|    T     | T |   T   |         T         |          T         |  
|    T     | F |   F   |         T         |          F         |

## #5 Paths
``` Java
Paths that achieve full path coverage:
12567
134357

This is a finite set because the numbers are countable.
